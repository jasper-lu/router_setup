Step 0: Install expect onto your terminal.

Step 1: Run init if you don't already have all of the necessary files. If it has been a while since you last copied over the files, run init anyway.

Step 2: Flash the router with the OpenWrt firmware (ends in factory.bin)
at 192.168.0.1

Step 3: Run the telnet script (./telnet)

Step 4: Run the flash script (./flash)

Step 5: Check to see everything is okay.

Future Steps:
- Automate the router firmware stuff with a python or whatever script??? (Is this even possible)
